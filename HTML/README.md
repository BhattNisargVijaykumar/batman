Day-5 (Basic of Data Structure)
Data Structure:- It is ways to store a different types of data in a one structure.

Algorithms:- Operations on different data structures + sets of instructions for executing them. 
It is also called a step by step procedure which we will perform in program of to get a desired output or solve a problem. 

Array:- It is Collection of items to be stored at Contiguous memory location.
It is use to store same type data in together or one by one memory location.

class:- It is blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 
It is one common object properties representation.

objects:- It is use for represents the real-life entities.



Day-6 (Linked List, Recursion, Big-O & Time Complexity)
Linked List:-A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 

types of Linked List:-
    Singly Linked List
    Doubly Linked List
    Circular Linked List
    Circular Doubly Linked List

#Singly Linked List:-
-It is the most common. Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

#Doubly Linked List:-
We add a pointer to the previous node in a doubly-linked list. Thus, we can go in either direction: forward or backward.

#Circular Linked List:-
A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element. This forms a circular loop.

#Circular Doubly Linked List:-
A Doubly Circular linked list or a circular two-way linked list is a more complex type of linked-list that contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node in the sequence. The difference between the doubly linked and circular doubly list is the same as that between a singly linked list and a circular linked list.

*Advantages Of Linked List:
    Dynamic data structure
    No memory wastage
    Implementation
    Insertion and Deletion Operations

*Disadvantages Of Linked List:
    Memory usage
    Traversal
    Reverse Traversing
    Random Access



Recursion:- Recursion is a process in which the function calls itself indirectly or directly in order to solve the problem.

#why use recursion:-
    1.Complex tasks can be broken down into simpler problems.
    2.Code using recursion is usually shorter and more elegant.
    3.Sequence generation is cleaner with recursion than with iteration.

#why not use recursion:-
    1.The recursive logic is usually harder to follow and debug.
    2.It increases memory usage and its Big O notation is often higher than the corresponding iterative solution. This means that recursion can be great for smaller programs but might lead to memory problems in bigger projects.



Big-O Notation:- Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.


Time Complexity:- By definition, the time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. Here, the length of input indicates the number of operations to be performed by the algorithm
